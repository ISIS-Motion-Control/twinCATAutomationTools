# twinCATAutomationTools
These are a work in progress set of tools for providing scripting functionality and automated setup/configuration of TwinCAT projects.
The current main release includes a "Test Crate Setup" tool that utilises the contents of a "Config" folder to setup a TwinCAT solution with axes and hardware for testing code releases.
